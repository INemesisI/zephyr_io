	bool "Flow - Fast Lightweight Object Wiring"
	select NET_BUF
	help
	  Enable the Flow subsystem. This provides a zero-copy
	  mechanism for distributing net_buf packets from sources to
	  multiple sinks using reference counting.

config FLOW_NAMES
	bool "Enable names for sources and sinks"
	default y if DEBUG
	help
	  Enable string names for packet sources, sinks, and event processors.
	  This adds a const char* field to each structure for debugging and
	  logging purposes. Disable to save memory in production builds.

config FLOW_STATS
	bool "Enable Flow statistics"
	default y if DEBUG
	help
	  Enable statistics tracking for packet sources and sinks.
	  This includes message counts, drop counts, and delivery counts.

	help
	  Number of runtime connections that can be allocated from the
	  internal pool. Each connection uses approximately 32 bytes.
	  Set this based on the maximum number of runtime connections
	  your application needs simultaneously.

	  Initialization priority for the Flow subsystem.
	  Should be high (late) to ensure sources and sinks are defined.
